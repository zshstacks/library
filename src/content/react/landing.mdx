## Overview

The landing is a single `LandingView` component with no animation libraries —
just Tailwind, `tw-animate-css`, a few custom keyframes declared in a JSX
`<style>` tag, and one piece of mouse-tracking state. Every visual effect is
explained below.

## Global styles foundation

### CSS variables and dark theme

The theme uses `oklch` for all color definitions. The SublimeHub dark
background is `#07141b` and the accent is `#38CA6B` (emerald green):

```css
.dark {
  --background: oklch(0.15 0.04 236); /* #07141b */
  --primary: oklch(0.72 0.18 145);    /* #38CA6B */
  --border: oklch(1 0 0 / 10%);
}
```

Using `oklch` instead of hex for variable definitions gives perceptually
uniform color mixing — gradients between two oklch values look more natural
than the same gradient between two hex values.

### Grid background

```css
@layer utilities {
  .bg-grid-pattern {
    background-size: 50px 50px;
    background-image:
      linear-gradient(to right, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03) 1px, transparent 1px),
      linear-gradient(to bottom, rgba(255, 255, 255, 0.03) 1px, transparent 1px);
    mask-image: linear-gradient(to bottom, black 40%, transparent 100%);
  }
}
```

Two overlapping linear gradients — one horizontal, one vertical — at 3%
white opacity produce a barely-visible grid. The `mask-image` gradient fades
the grid to transparent as it approaches the bottom of the viewport, so the
pattern doesn't compete visually with content lower on the page.

### Scrollbar

```css
::-webkit-scrollbar { width: 10px; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-track { background: #07141b; }
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb {
  background-color: #1a2c38;
  border-radius: 9999px;
  border: 2px solid #07141b;
}
::-webkit-scrollbar-thumb:hover { background-color: #38CA6B; }
```

The `border: 2px solid #07141b` on the thumb creates the illusion of padding
between the thumb and the track by matching the track color. `border-radius: 9999px`
makes it pill-shaped. Firefox gets the same treatment via `scrollbar-width: thin`
and `scrollbar-color: #1a2c38 #07141b` on `*`.

## Background layers

The entire background is a stack of three `fixed inset-0` divs with
`pointer-events-none` so they never intercept clicks:

```tsx
<div className="fixed inset-0 z-0 pointer-events-none">
  {/* 1. grid */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-grid-pattern opacity-30" />

  {/* 2. vignette - darkens the grid toward the edges */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-[radial-gradient(circle_at_50%_50%,transparent_0%,#07141b_100%)]" />

  {/* 3. mouse-follow glow */}
  <div
    className="absolute w-[400px] h-[400px] bg-[#38CA6B]/5 blur-[120px] rounded-full transition-transform duration-1000 ease-out hidden lg:block"
    style={{
      transform: `translate(${mousePos.x - 300}px, ${mousePos.y - 300}px)`,
    }}
  />
</div>
```

Layer 1 is the grid. Layer 2 is a radial gradient going from transparent
at the centre to the background color at the edges — this darkens the grid
near the edges and creates a subtle depth effect. Layer 3 is the mouse glow.

### Mouse-follow glow

```tsx
const [mousePos, setMousePos] = useState({ x: 0, y: 0 });

useEffect(() => {
  const handleMouseMove = (e: MouseEvent) => {
    setMousePos({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
  };
  window.addEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
  return () => window.removeEventListener("mousemove", handleMouseMove);
}, []);
```

Raw cursor coordinates go into state on every `mousemove`. The glow element
is a 400×400 div with `blur-[120px]` — the large blur radius turns it into
a soft radial gradient that follows the cursor. The offset `mousePos.x - 300`
(half of 400px) centres the element on the cursor rather than anchoring its
top-left corner there.

`transition-transform duration-1000 ease-out` on the element itself adds
intentional lag — the glow trails behind the cursor with a 1-second ease
instead of snapping to it instantly, which feels much more atmospheric.

`hidden lg:block` keeps it desktop-only since a touch device never fires
`mousemove`.

<Callout type="tip">
    Keep the glow opacity very low (`bg-[#38CA6B]/5` = 5%) and the blur very
    high (`blur-[120px]`). A more visible glow reads as a UI bug; this level
    is subconscious — users feel the page is alive without noticing why.
</Callout>

## Reveal animation system

All entrance animations use `tw-animate-css`, which provides the
`animate-in`, `fade-in`, `slide-in-from-bottom-4`, and `fill-mode-both`
utility classes via:

```css
@import "tw-animate-css";
```

A shared class string is applied to every section:

```tsx
const revealClasses =
  "animate-in fade-in slide-in-from-bottom-4 duration-1000 fill-mode-both";
```

Elements fade in while sliding up 16px (`bottom-4`). `fill-mode-both` means
the element starts in the `from` state before the animation fires, preventing
a flash of the visible final state on load. Staggered `delay-*` classes on
each section create a waterfall effect:

```tsx
<div className={`text-left ${revealClasses} delay-200`}>   {/* hero text */}
<div className={`... ${revealClasses} delay-500`}>          {/* hero card */}
<div className={`... ${revealClasses} delay-600`}>          {/* features heading */}
<div className={`... ${revealClasses} delay-700`}>          {/* uptime card */}
<div className={`... ${revealClasses} delay-800`}>          {/* crypto card */}
<div className={`... ${revealClasses} delay-900`}>          {/* tech stack */}
```

## Custom keyframe animations

Three custom animations are defined in a JSX `<style>` block at the bottom
of the component. Putting them here instead of in `globals.css` keeps them
colocated with the component that uses them.

```tsx
<style jsx global>{`
  @keyframes grow {
    from { transform: scaleY(0.4); }
    to   { transform: scaleY(1); }
  }
  .animate-grow {
    animation: grow 1.5s ease-in-out infinite alternate;
    transform-origin: bottom;
  }

  @keyframes float {
    0%, 100% { transform: translateY(0px); }
    50%       { transform: translateY(-20px); }
  }
  .animate-float {
    animation: float 6s ease-in-out infinite;
  }

  @keyframes shimmer {
    0%   { background-position: 0% 50%; }
    50%  { background-position: 100% 50%; }
    100% { background-position: 0% 50%; }
  }
  .animate-shimmer {
    animation: shimmer 3s ease-in-out infinite;
  }
`}</style>
```

### shimmer — gradient text

The hero heading uses a moving gradient for the word "CONTROL.":

```tsx
<span className="text-transparent bg-clip-text bg-gradient-to-r from-[#38CA6B] via-emerald-200 to-[#38CA6B] bg-[length:200%_auto] animate-shimmer">
  CONTROL.
</span>
```

`bg-clip-text` + `text-transparent` makes the gradient show through the text
shape. `bg-[length:200%_auto]` makes the gradient background twice as wide as
the element so `background-position` can animate from `0%` to `100%` and back —
the visible portion of the gradient shifts left to right, appearing to shimmer.

### float — dashboard card

The live dashboard preview on the right of the hero section floats:

```tsx
<div className={`relative hidden lg:block animate-float ${revealClasses} delay-500`}>
```

`float` oscillates `translateY` between `0px` and `-20px` over 6 seconds.
The `ease-in-out` timing function means acceleration and deceleration at both
ends, giving it a smooth breathing quality rather than a mechanical bounce.

### grow — response latency bars

The bar chart in the dashboard preview uses `animate-grow` with staggered
`animationDelay` on each bar:

```tsx
{[40, 70, 45, 90, 65, 80, 55, 75].map((h, i) => (
  <div
    key={i}
    className="flex-1 bg-[#38CA6B]/30 rounded-t-sm animate-grow"
    style={{
      height: `${h}%`,
      animationDelay: `${i * 0.1}s`,
    }}
  />
))}
```

`transform-origin: bottom` on the animation makes the bars grow upward from
their base. `infinite alternate` means the animation reverses at the end
instead of jumping back to the start — the bars gently pulse up and down.
Each bar's 100ms stagger creates a wave effect across the chart.

## Mobile menu

The mobile menu slides in from above using a CSS transform transition rather
than conditional rendering:

```tsx
<div
  className={`fixed inset-0 z-[49] bg-[#07141b] flex flex-col items-center justify-center gap-8 transition-transform duration-500 md:hidden ${
    isMenuOpen ? "translate-y-0" : "-translate-y-full"
  }`}
>
```

`fixed inset-0` makes it cover the entire screen. When `isMenuOpen` is
`false`, `-translate-y-full` pushes it exactly 100% of its own height
above the viewport — invisible but present in the DOM. When `isMenuOpen`
flips to `true`, `translate-y-0` slides it back into view. `duration-500`
and the CSS `transition-transform` handle the animation.

This approach is preferable to unmounting the menu because the transition
plays on both open and close, and there's no layout shift from the element
entering or leaving the DOM.

<Callout type="note">
    The nav uses `z-50` and the mobile menu uses `z-[49]`. The nav stays
    on top of the overlay so the close button (rendered in the nav) remains
    clickable while the menu is open.
</Callout>

## Navbar backdrop blur

```tsx
<nav className="fixed top-0 inset-x-0 z-50 ... backdrop-blur-md border-b border-white/5">
```

`backdrop-blur-md` blurs everything behind the navbar, giving it a frosted
glass effect as the user scrolls over content. `border-b border-white/5` adds
a barely-visible bottom border that separates the nav from the page without
being heavy.

## Feature cards

The two feature cards use hover-reveal inner glows:

```tsx
<div className="p-8 rounded-[2.5rem] bg-gradient-to-br from-[#38CA6B]/10 to-transparent border border-[#38CA6B]/20 hover:border-[#38CA6B]/40 transition-all group relative overflow-hidden">
  {/* inner glow layer — fades in on hover */}
  <div className="absolute inset-0 bg-gradient-to-br from-[#38CA6B]/5 to-transparent opacity-0 group-hover:opacity-100 transition-opacity" />
  {/* content */}
  <div className="relative z-10">...</div>
</div>
```

The inner glow div starts at `opacity-0` and transitions to `opacity-100` on
`group-hover`. Using a separate element for the hover glow (rather than
changing the background of the card directly) allows the base gradient to
coexist with the hover state gradient — the hover state adds intensity without
replacing the resting appearance.

`rounded-[2.5rem]` with `overflow-hidden` ensures the inner glow doesn't
bleed outside the card's rounded corners.

## Live ticker

The marquee-style ticker in `globals.css`:

```css
@keyframes ticker {
  0%   { transform: translateX(0); }
  100% { transform: translateX(-50%); }
}

.animate-ticker {
  display: flex;
  width: max-content;
  animation: ticker 30s linear infinite;
}

.animate-ticker:hover {
  animation-play-state: paused;
}
```

The content is duplicated so the ticker is twice as wide as needed. Scrolling
by exactly 50% (`translateX(-50%)`) positions the duplicate at the same
starting point as the original, creating a seamless loop. Hover pauses it
via `animation-play-state`.

## Pulsing live indicator

The "Live WebSocket Powered" badge in the hero uses a CSS ping animation to
indicate active status:

```tsx
<span className="relative flex h-2 w-2">
  <span className="animate-ping absolute inline-flex h-full w-full rounded-full bg-[#38CA6B] opacity-75"></span>
  <span className="relative inline-flex rounded-full h-2 w-2 bg-[#38CA6B]"></span>
</span>
```

`animate-ping` is a built-in Tailwind animation that scales the element from
`1` to `2` while fading from `opacity-75` to `0`. Stacking a static circle
underneath gives the effect of a solid dot with an outward ripple.
